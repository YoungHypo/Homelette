## Problem Scenario

At UCSB, finding short-term housing or a sublet is a recurring challenge for many students. Whether they're graduating a quarter late, studying abroad, or simply staying for summer jobs, students often need temporary housing solutions. Currently, students rely heavily on Facebook groups to sublease or find subletters, but these groups have become increasingly overrun by bots, scammers, and outdated listings.

For subleasers, inboxes are often flooded with irrelevant or scam messages, and for subletters, sifting through unverified listings or dealing with scam attempts wastes valuable time. The chaotic and unreliable nature of these platforms has left students frustrated, often struggling to find safe, secure, and convenient housing matches. Thereâ€™s no efficient, centralized platform for this process, making it difficult to verify if listings are still available or trustworthy.
