### 2. Resource in Slack Channel

Some of the group members posted a link to a resource they used in the platform_react_unity channel on Slack. We also reacted and responded to a few of the links there. This was recorded in the LEARNING.md file. 

### 3. Benefits/Challenges

Benefits of using expo is the cross-platform compatibility and that it is easy to learn with React. Since Expo is compatible on multiple platforms, there must be more testing for all the devices.
