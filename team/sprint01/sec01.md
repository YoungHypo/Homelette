### 3. App Idea

# App Idea

App designed to easily connect subleasers with subletters in Isla Vista

# Scenario

At UCSB, there’s a large number of people who both have to live here for one extra quarter or who have to open their space for other people to live for a quarter. For example, there are people who work in Santa Barbara over summer and need a spot to live, people who only need to stay for one extra quarter in order to graduate, people who are studying abroad a quarter and can’t live in SB, etc. Right now, there’s not a proper way for people to find each other. There are Facebook groups, but recently they’ve been overrun by bots and scammers, so it’s extremely difficult to find real people, and in general it’s hard to scroll and find your perfect pick. There needs to be a more centralized way for people to meet others who they’d be willing to sublease to/sublet from. This app would allow people to make profiles with specific preferences on things like rent cost, number of roommates, furnishings, distance from campus, and more. It would allow people to verify their identity and be sure that they’re talking to real people, not scammers. It would have a messaging system where you can discuss logistics with potential subleasers/subletters. Additionally, it would have resources for legal templates regarding the subleasing contract.

## Next Steps
