### 1. Standup

Our team decided on using Expo to create the frontend of our app. We also discussed the problem scenario and decided that we should build one app that can be used for both subleasers and subletters.

| Collin      | Just joined the team                                         |

### 2. Tech Stack

- We will be using Expo for the frontend
- We're undecided on the backend

### 3. Problem Scenario

- When subletting, it's common to have an inbox flooded with bots and scam messages. As a subleaser, many experience the problem of having to scroll through residences that either aren't relevant to them or are no longer available. With our Tinder-like app, subleasers will be able to swipe right on residences they are interested in, and subletters will be able to respond to messages they receieve for the properties they post.
- To combat scamming, we'll verify the email used to sign up for the account ends in .edu
- We'll implement an algorithm that recommends similar housing to users based on right-swipes
- 1 app - one section for subletters, one for subleasers

### 4. Updated team norms

- Arrive at meetings on time and be prepared.
- Document progress and maintain clear communication.
- Don't be afraid to ask for help.
- Everyone should be honest.
- Everyone should have the chance to contribute to meetings.

## Next Steps

- **Action Items**:
  - Set up next meeting time
  - Set up development environments
  - Complete homework
