# Starting Point

There is no page for messages and the Chat button on the rent page does not do anything.

# Main information

There is now a Messages page to see saved conversations. Users can tap on each conversation and send messages within that conversation. Additionally, users can start a conversation with the author of a listing by using the Chat button on the Rent page. The backend Firebase logic and frontend UI are implemented, although the UI is not fully polished.
