## Benefits and Challenges of Expo (Sec02) - 10-11-2024

### Benefits

- **Smooth Development Process**: Expo has many libraries available for easier development and features such as hot reloading
- **Cross-Platform**: We don't need separate codebases for iOS and Android
- **Easy to Learn**: It's similar to React (it has components) and Next (file-based routing)
- **Lots of Resources**: Expo is very popular among the React Native community, so there is an ample amount of resources to learn it

### Challenges

- **Extra Testing Required**: We have to make sure our software works on a wide range of devices
- **Performance Overhead**: There can be a performance overhead due to the abstraction layer provided by Expo.
