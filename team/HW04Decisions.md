## Planned Contribution
### Amy
I plan to implement a favorited listings feature that allows users to favorite and unfavorite listings directly from the RentPage. The heart icon on each listing will be functional and intuitive to use, and the favorites will be stored persistently in the backend. Additionally, I will create a dedicated "Favorited Listings" page within the userâ€™s profile, displaying all saved favorite listings in an accessible format. 
### Collin
### Allen
I will be implementing the chat feature where subtenants who are interested in a property can start a chat with that property owner. This includes a basic frontend interface for the chat page as well as the backend collections/logic for the chat.
### Jason
My plan is to do unit testing for some of the pages and functions we currently have. I'm planning on starting with the RentPage, and then going through the rest of the pages. I am also considering doing some user evaluation  with different UI designs (like having the pages ordered in a different way).
### Haibo
- Draft design documents
- Preparation of a preliminary user manual
- Standardize repo contributions (CI check and installation guide)
### Jonathan
I will implement end-to-end testing for the our app. I will begin the tests at the login/signup screen and end with a lease posted or message sent to a subletter about a potential property. I will probably simulate a couple of other actions paths as well.
