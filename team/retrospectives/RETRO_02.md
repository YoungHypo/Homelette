# Date of Retrospective: 11/08/24

* Led by: Jonathan Herring
* Present: Amy Wang, Haibo Yang, Collin Qian, Allen Qiu, Jason Vu
* Absent: N/A

## Action item (experiment)
Push more features that users expect to have on our app
    - These features can be found in our MVP feedback.

## Goals
* Improve efficiency on pull requests
    - Include pictures in our app in our PRs (when applicable) to show changes

## Change
* Change our stories to be issues on the Kanban board
    - We are still going to have user stories, but we are also going to list sub issues for easier visibility for the TA to grade.


## Measurement
* The Kanban board should be more cluttered, but people can easily tell when goals are completed.


## Retro Assessment
* It went alright, and the retro went fairly quick. It was fairly disorganized because we had to figure out what was needed in our Retro. 

## Retro Experiment Outcome
* The experiment was a success. Amy's pull request documented the changes she made for the UI, which made the pull request very easy to read through and confirm that the changes were fine. We also added more issues to the Kanban board, so our Kanban board is more populated. This should make it easier for the TAs to grade our work.
