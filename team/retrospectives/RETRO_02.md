# Date of Retrospective: 11/08/24

* Led by: Jonathan Herring
* Present: Amy Wang, Haibo Yang, Collin Qian, Allen Qiu, Jason Vu
* Absent: N/A

## Action item (experiment)
*  Push more features that users expect to have on our app
    - These features can be found in our MVP feedback.

## Goals
* Improve efficiency on pull requests
    - Include pictures in our app in our PRs (when applicable) to show changes

## Change
* Change our stories to be issues on the Kanban board
    - We are still going to have user stories, but we are also going to list sub issues for easier visibility for the TA to grade.


## How to measure if the team achieved the goal?
* The Kanban board should be more cluttered, but people can easily tell when goals are completed.


## Retro Assessment
* It went alright, and the retro went fairly quick. It was fairly disorganized because we had to figure out what was needed in our Retro. 

## Retro Experiment Outcome (TODO)
