* Implement code reviews on PRs (have 2 people review)

## Action item

* a goal: identify something the team wants to get better at
  - quicker meetings 
  - build out MVP
* a change: identify one thing that the team will change about how it works together
  - timebox our meetings (limit standups to 5 minutes)
  - discuss and create deadlines for issues
* a measurement: identify at least one way to measure whether the change helped the team achieve the goal, or move closer to it.
  - how many issues we create in the sprint
  - how long our meetings are
  - how many PRs since last meeting

## Optional

* MVP shouldn't have recommendations

## Retro Assessment (for retro leader)

* A brief description of what retro outline or process you used.
  - I asked 4 questions: what went well, what could've been better, what we will do differently, and then action items.
* A brief assessment of how it went.
  - I think it went fine! We didn't have that much done in this past sprint so it was hard to make any real changes, other than the change to get more stuff done.
* What advice would you give to the next person leading a retro
  based on what you learned today?
  - Next retro will be different hoping we are pushing lots of code and making lots of contributions!
