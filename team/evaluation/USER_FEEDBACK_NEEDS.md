# User Feedback Needs

## User Preference between 2 designs and A/B study on two different designs
- We would love to have feedback on the color choices we made. Our current choice is using bright yellow colors.
- We would also want feedback on the UI, in regards to the different tabs at the bottom of the screen (like RentPage, choosing to include a profile page or not).
- User preferences on font?

## User Satisfaction
- We would also like to see how users favor using the rental page. Does everything make sense from a user standpoint? Is there anything the user dislikes?
- Another thing is seeing how the users interact with the map and use the markers.
- Curious about if the user likes the current features on the profile - short bio, major, graduation year or if there are features are missing
